<br>
## Overview  
This project was created for our intro to engineering class.  
We were asked to make a robot that would complete a task powered by an arduino for under $35.  
We designed a robot that would pick up a soda can, then take it to a location and drop it, essentially recycling it.  
<br>
To sense the can we use a flex sensor, to drive the system we used two continously rotating servos.  
To grab the can we use a standard servo.  
The whole frame was laser cut out at our maker lab.
